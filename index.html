            <h1> GIS and Crime </h1>
   
   
    <h2> What is GIS? </h2>
    
    <p> GIS is  is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface.It also can show many different kinds of data on one map. This enables people to more easily see, analyze, and understand patterns and relationships.</p>
  
    <h2> How can GIS prevent crime? </h2>

    <p> It is used to prevent crime by giving police officers and offficials a better understanding of the nature of homicide, examining whether and how locations of incidents coincide with home addresses of victims and offenders. For example, the Gang Reduction Program, a federally funded demonstration program, uses GIS to help them on evaluating where gangs are targeted, where they might move, and areas in which there is no gang activity going on.    </p>

    <h2> Has GIS been found useful to be used against crime rates? </h2>

    <p> According to the Illinois state police,"It's no accident that traffic fatalities have declined in Cook County since 1996. GIS has helped the Illinois State Police (ISP) Department pursue a vigorous enforcement program that reduced traffic fatalities 42 percent during its first year in operation. The Department found GIS a powerful tool for managing and using data and has employed a many-faceted approach for implementing GIS use throughout the organization." </p>

    <h2> How can GIS be useful for future referneces and also the future? </h2>
    <div>

    <p> It can be useful for future references by examining where each crime is commited, when and how it was commited, and the amount of times it was comitted, and with that, hhelp us predict how future crimes may occur, where they most likely will occur, and when it most likely will occur. With GIS in tact, crime rates are to decrease over the years and be more pinpoint onto who did the crime.  </p>
